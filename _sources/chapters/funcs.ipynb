    "They are like versatile tools in a programmer's toolbox, allowing you to encapsulate a set of instructions and give them a name. \n",
    "Functions play a pivotal role in making code organized, reusable, and easier to understand. \n",
    "Their importance cannot be overstated, as they enable you to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks, making your code more modular and maintainable. \n",
    "Key features of functions include the ability to accept input, perform specific operations, and return results. \n",
    "This versatility, along with the power to create your functions, empowers programmers to tackle a wide range of problems with elegance and efficiency.\n",
