    "# Object-Oriented Programming: Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we will take a look at Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python! \n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a way that reflects the real-world entities and their interactions. \n",
    "In Python, OOP is a fundamental aspect of the language, providing a robust and flexible approach to designing and organizing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However before we will start learning OOP I want to cover some aspects of Namespaces and Scopes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Namespace and Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in our discussions about variables in Python, we established that a variable essentially acts as a link to an object in the computer's memory. Visualizing this relationship, we can group variables and their corresponding objects into pairs, creating a structured mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "namespace = {\"obj1\": obj1, \"obj2\": obj2, ...}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply is a namespace in Python. So in Python, namespace act as dynamic containers, responsible for establishing a mapping between names and objects. Think of a namespace as an intelligent dictionary, where names are keys, and objects are values. This dynamic mapping allows Python to efficiently manage and organize the various elements within your program.\n",
    "For next code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Variable \"x\" pointing to an object in memory\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "we could say that namespace mapping is `{\"x\": [1, 2, 3]}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we like to keep things organized. So, the `print` function and our variable `x` don't share the same space. \n",
    "Why? Well, Python has different areas, called \"scopes\", and each of them has its own place to store names and their stuff. \n",
    "It's like having separate rooms for different things. Now, let's explore these scopes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local scope\n",
    "**Local scope** refers to the part of your code, usually within a function or method, where variables have local significance. Each function call creates its own local namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is called, a local namespace is created, acting as a container for variables within that function. This namespace is isolated from the global namespace."

If it's not there, you might check another room nearby (enclosing room), and so on. It's like a step-by-step search through rooms until you find what you're looking for!\n",
