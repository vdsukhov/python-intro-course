    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore **control flow**, which determines the sequence in which a program's code runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've executed all our commands one after the other, like reading a book from start to finish. But there are times when we want the program to behave differently. Sometimes, we only want certain parts of the code to run if specific conditions are met, and other times, we want to repeat a piece of code several times. The following chart represents possible options for control flow in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into control flow, let's first understand the `input` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `input` function\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} ./pics/flow.png\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we learned that programming generally involves input data, commands for the computer in Python's language, and resulting output from our programs. However, we have only covered the second and third components of this fundamental programming concept. Now, we will learn the first way to obtain input data and interact with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` function in Python is a fundamental tool for interactive programming. It allows you to collect user input directly from the keyboard during the execution of your program. When you call `input()`, the program pauses and waits for the user to type something and press \"Enter\". Whatever the user enters is typically stored as a string. You can then use this input to make your program more interactive and responsive, whether it's for gathering user preferences, processing user-generated data, or creating simple text-based games. It's important to note that you can convert the input to different data types (like integers or floats) using typecasting if needed. The `input()` function significantly enhances the user experience in Python programs by enabling two-way communication between the program and its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "user_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"user_name =\", user_name)\n",
    "print(\"type(user_name):\", type(user_name))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Possible example of output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter your name: Vladimir\n",
    "user_name = Vladimir\n",
    "type(user_name): <class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the string `\"Enter your name: \"` specifies the `prompt` of `input()` function.\n",
    "This string is displayed in standard output. After that, Python reads all input until the Enter button is pressed.\n",
    "The `prompt` could be omitted:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "user_name = input()\n",
    "print(\"user_name =\", user_name)\n",
    "print(\"type(user_name):\", type(user_name))\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the program behavior is the same except that we do not print the message of the `input` function in the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, by default, we read input and store it as a `str` data type object. If necessary, we can use type conversion:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "number_1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "number_2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "print(number_1 * number_2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the first number: 42\n",
    "Enter the second number: 8\n",
    "336\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to start learning the different ways of controlling program code flow. Let's consider the following situation, which should help us understand conditional statements. Imagine you have written a message, and now another person must decide whether to read it or skip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<video autoplay loop playsinline controls muted>\n",
    "    <source src=\"../_static/videos/phone_notification.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n",
    "</video>\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, let's make our decision very simple: if we write something, person will always read it. \n",
    "Now, we just need to use proper Python syntax to implement such a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = input(\"Enter your message: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if message != \"\":\n",
    "    print(\"Your message was read\")\n",
    "print(\"End of the program\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is the possible example of output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Enter your message: I always wanted to say you something\n",
    "Your message was read\n",
    "End of the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have a message specified by us. To specify the part of the code that is specific to a condition, we use the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use the Python keyword `if`, and after that, we place the condition. In our case, the condition is very simple: we check whether the message is non-empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we have the body of the conditional statement, which is specified by indentation and goes after the `:` symbol. Indentation refers to the space at the beginning of a line of writing when it starts further away from the edge of the paper than all the other lines.\n",
    "Ok, now let's assume that we do not send anything and let's check result of our program.\n",
    "Then the output of programs is following one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Enter your message: \n",
    "End of the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, if we write something, the condition `message != \"\"` is true, and we execute the code inside the conditional statement body. Otherwise, we skip all statements inside the conditional construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, you can put several statements inside the body by using indentation for all of them to emphasize that they are statements inside the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "Actually, there is no need to explicitly use the statement `if message != \"\":`. Instead, we can simply replace it with `if message:`. Python automatically tries to convert the object to a `bool` type inside of condition, and an empty string is a falsy value.\n",
    "To summarize, we can use the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = input(\"Enter your message: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if message:\n",
    "    print(\"Your message was read\")\n",
    "print(\"End of the program\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` - `else`\n",
    "Ok, now let's consider another situation where a person reads all messages except for messages from a specific person.\n",
    "If we got the message from this person we on purpose ignore it.\n",
    "To do so we can use an `else` statement which is used in conjunction with an `if` statement to specify what should happen if the condition in the `if` statement is false.\n",
    "Here is an possible code example to handle such case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "message = input(\"Enter your message: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if message and name == \"Vladimir\":\n",
    "    print(\"Your message was read\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Message was ignored\")\n",
    "print(\"End of the program\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are possible outputs for two different inputs:\n",
    "::::{grid}\n",
    ":gutter: 2\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{grid-item-card} Input-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter your name: Vladimir\n",
    "Enter your message: I always wanted to say u smth\n",
    "Your message was read\n",
    "End of the program\n",
    "```\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{grid-item-card} Input-2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter your name: Lucy\n",
    "Enter your message: Hi. How are u?\n",
    "Message was ignored\n",
    "End of the program\n",
    "```\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "::::\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example person reads message if the message came from `\"Vladimir\"` otherwise the person ingore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` - `elif` - `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the message is from `\"Vladimir\"`, the person reads it and starts typing back.\n",
    "- If the message is from `\"Lucy\"`, the person ignores it.\n",
    "- In all other cases person just read the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this task, the `elif` statement can be used. `elif` (short for \"else if\") is used when multiple conditions need to be checked in sequence. \n",
    "It allows you to test a series of conditions and execute the first block of code whose condition is true.\n",
    "The possible code could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "message = input(\"Enter your message: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if message and name == \"Vladimir\":\n",
    "    print(\"Message was read\")\n",
    "    print(\"Typing ...\")\n",
    "elif message and name == \"Lucy\":\n",
    "    print(\"Message was ignored\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Message was read\")\n",
    "```\n",
